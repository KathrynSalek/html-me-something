                    <h2>Focus and Development</h2>
                    <p id="FD">I'm a data driven marketer and customer engagement advocate.  I believe great marketing serves the consumer by providing them the most relevant information about products and services that they want and/or need. Great marketing also establishes a connection and trust with those it serves.  More and more technology is the vehicle for connecting to and serving consumers.</p>  
                    <p id="FD">Completing the LaunchCode curriculm will help me to be an even more technically skilled at understanding and contributing to cutting edge digital consumer experiences.  On the front end, I will be able to better lead advanced site experiences that dynamically change based on the visitor's prior experience with the brand.  On the back-end, I will be able to better lead the data collection, stitching and analysis efforts that supply the information to fuel superior experiences.</p>

                    <p>I currently lead the conversion rate optimization program (web and responsive mobile). By focusing on audience segmentation and personalization for improved relevancy and reduced friction I deliver greater customer acquisition and retention. I play a key role in improving customer experience (CX) by conducting split testing and data analysis.</p>

                   	<p>I managed a multi-million dollar direct marketing program, driving omnichannel campaigns focused on email, SMS, MMS, mobile push notifications, in-theater display, and direct mail marketing. Acting as SME, I took charge of responsive design, dynamic content, and data analytics. I was also able to devise strategies that incorporated video, serialized coupons, and personalized messaging.</p>

                    <p>At AutoZone, I was in charge of direct marketing and operations for a large multi-channel loyalty program, planning strategy for the website, social media, SEM, online display, TV/Radio, sweepstakes, and brick-and-mortar signage.  I took the AutoZone Rewards website from beta to national rollout, developing loyalty program policy, training, systems, multi-channel communications, and branding. The customer rewards website redesign and integration into the mobile app was a great opportunity to expand market share.
